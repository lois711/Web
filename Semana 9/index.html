	<p id="par2">Mount Rushmore employed over 400 people, and its contruction spanned over 14 years, ending with the start of WWII. They took breaks in the winter For some, working on "The Faces" was just another job, but was a call for others. Some of the workers died later of silicosis, this was caused by the dust that the they inhaled while they were carving the granite.</p>
